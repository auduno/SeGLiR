SeGLiR
======

**SeGLiR** is a javascript library for rapid A/B-testing with **Sequential Generalized Likelihood Ratio Tests**.

For a brief explanation of this family of tests, see [this post](http://auduno.com/seglir/). SeGLiR currently contain tests for comparing bernoulli proportions (for instance comparing two versions for conversion), but it's also planned to contain tests for comparing normal means, as well as tests for choosing the best arm in a multi-armed bandit setting with Î´-PAC guarantees (ref. Emilie Kaufman).

### Usage ###

Download via node etc. Note that SeGLiR requires 'jStat'.

```javascript
var glr = require(seglir);
var test = new glr.test("bernoulli","two-sided",0.01,0.05,0.10);
// collect data
...
test.add([1,undefined]);
test.add([0,0]);
test.add([undefined,1]);
...
// when function returns 'true', 'false' or 'undefined' test is concluded
test.getResults()
// get bias-adjusted estimates 
test.estimates()
```
